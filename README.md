- ðŸ‘€ Focus on the 2 major ways to access DATA in databases: 
- OLTP -transactional access, data is modified often, in small amounts/ CRUDE
- vs OLAP -analytical access, large amounts of data + complex is queried

 Question answered:  Why do we need to duplicate our data /remodel it for analytics?

NB:   Newer technologies and optimization techniques have allowed OLTP systems to handle a broader range of analytical queries efficiently. In some cases, with proper indexing and query optimization, OLTP databases can provide satisfactory performance for certain analytics use cases without the need for a separate analytical system. However, for complex analytical workloads involving extensive data aggregation and summarization, OLAP systems still offer distinct advantages. It's essential to evaluate the specific requirements of your analytics workload and choose the appropriate data storage system accordingly.
